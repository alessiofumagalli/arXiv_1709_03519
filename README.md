# Abstract
We consider a Darcy problem for saturated porous media written in dual formulation in presence of a fully immersed inclusion. The lowest order virtual element method is employed to derive the discrete approximation. In the present work we study the effect of cells with cuts on the numerical solution, able to geometrically handle in a more natural way the inclusion tips. The numerical results show the validity of the proposed approach.
